## Post location indicators
Show nearby tether post locations before they're visible on screen. Could be subtle glows, arrows, or icons at the screen edge pointing toward posts within a certain range. Helps the player plan their route without memorizing the map.

## Smoother camera movement
Camera transitions feel jarring, especially when connecting to a new post. Ideas: smooth pan/ease when the player teleports or snaps to a new tether range, slower lerp during large position corrections, brief cinematic pan toward the new post before snapping back to the player. Generally aim for less abrupt camera motion throughout.
