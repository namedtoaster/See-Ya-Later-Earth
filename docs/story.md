# Story

## Summary

1. Jet loves space/exploration and is frustrated with the seeming lack of interest from pretty much everyone else on earth
2. Jet joins the space program and puts his talents to use by picking up where earth's space exploration left off
3. During his mission, Jet finds out more and more about his mother's attempts of space exploration
4. Jet makes it farther than anyone has before (besides his mom) and picks up new technologies along the way
5. Jet discovers what happens to his mom and returns to earth to help continue the advancement of space exploration

## Thematic Direction

Exploring different planets to find a new place to settle down and trying to forget the terrible truth that was the difficulty of being human.

- Maybe everything you discover/learn on each planet is one more element that helps you save earth
- Even though throughout most of the game your attitude towards earth is growingly apathetic, it turns out the tech you discover and the resources you find end up being used in the end to save earth
- For example, teleportation tech helps earth evacuate at the last minute; and/or shielding tech helps protect the earth from hostile aliens

## Background

Jet, the last space cadet, is sick and tired of humanity. All they care about is being plugged into their simulation seats. Think Dad's recliner meets VR technology. All they want is to buy the latest upgrades, download the newest SimPacks, and mostly argue with each other why their favorite DLC is the best. Jet feels like he is the only person who wants to explore, pave his own path. Everyone else thinks space is stupid when SimSeats let a person explore whatever they desire in the virtual world, or so they think.

Jet has always had his sights set on the sky. It's why he kept multiple accounts in the top 10 of SimFlight. It's how he got the nickname Jet, for his love of the JR-101 Blackbird. But it always bothered him that he never actually felt the G-force, nor heard the sonic boom. His feet weren't actually walking on Mars in SimSpace, and he was positive a real hyperjump wasn't just a loading screen between levels.

So he signed up for NASA Space Cadet Training in March 2098. The only time he ever found use for a pop up ad. After his initial interview with NASA 'Director' Lizz, a hastily promoted intern/rocket scientist/director after the Asteroid Collisions, the program took 6 months. His extensive SimFlight and SimSpace hours really cut down the training time. He was the only one. All his instructors were robots and old recordings of lectures from the 2050's, when NASA was gearing up for its first manned mission to Mars.

### Historical Timeline

- **2050s**: NASA gears up for first manned Mars mission
- **2058**: Commander Whitney first lands on Mars, the golden age of Solar drives / Lightspeed travel
- **2060s**: Solar technology rapidly progresses, becomes world standard. Free power for everyone. Nations share space tech.
- **Late 2070s**: The Gyarados missions — 3 spacecraft attempt to travel through the Asteroid Belt. All 3 meet untimely ends (Asteroid Collisions). Jet's mom commanded Gyarados 3.
- **Meanwhile**: SimSeats ramp in popularity. Outer world disaster + free power + endless entertainment + same day delivery = world peace and halted space travel.
- **March 2098**: Jet signs up for NASA Space Cadet Training
- **Fall 2098**: Jet sets sail for space

> Now Jet preps to set sail for space in the fall of 2098. Looking for his own adventure! And someplace he can breathe. He takes off full speed ahead with no intention of looking back. See ya later Earth.

## Character Arcs

### Jet

- **Player first views Jet as**: A careless cowboy type. Bothered that Earth no longer cares about space travel because that's all he cares about — that's where his Mom went MIA.
- **Underneath**: His sarcasm and "act first, think later" attitude is truly a front to hide his desire to discover his mom's whereabouts. She is his deepest human connection (Dad is dead / he was adopted). She is his only connection to Earth and she is in space... See Ya Later Earth!
- **What does Jet learn?** TBD — needs resolution. Is this all just for fun, or does he grow?

### The Aliens

- Good vs. bad — how exactly are they going to help/hurt Jet?
- The Jupiter aliens are defending their base/territory that Jet has wandered into. Once tension dies down, Jet talks with them and learns they met his Mom.
- Besides having to fight some aliens, what is the actual conflict? Maybe the "good" aliens seem like they're helping, but will actually try to destroy you?
- How will Jet reveal more information about the aliens? Ruins? Cave writings? Logs?

### Jet's Mother (Commander Slyfer)

**Reveal sequence through ship computer:**

1. Jet's mom was an astronaut commander → player sees Jet following in her footsteps
2. **At Mars**: Player learns Mom's ship lost contact with Mars base during travel through asteroid belt. Officially MIA. So Jet has strong desire to pass through the belt to see if Mom is alive/dead.
3. **On Jupiter**: Jet meets aliens and learns they also met his Mom → sense of urgency to explore the final 3 planets where Mom could turn up on any level

> This is where the story is fully ramped up, like a rollercoaster.

**Mom's personality**: Constant pushing forward. Not grandiose goals, but she wants to travel space as far as possible and as long as possible. Her grand endeavor is to do what no human has done before and prove that determination makes the impossible, possible.

**What she reveals to Jet**: He has lost all motivation and chose space travel because it's what he knows and is safe to him (even though to the player it sounds crazy). As he follows her footsteps, his view of her transitions: mother → explorer → "pushing forward is what humans do. It is how we live."

### Two Possible Endings

**Option A: Mom is ALIVE**
- On Neptune, finds Mom marooned on planet. Ship is broken, she is injured/sick.
- Some medicine can be done by Jupiter aliens but she needs to return to earth for life-saving operation.

**Option B: Mom is DEAD**
- On Neptune, discovers remains of ship and concludes something blew up.
- Finds her space suit far out from ship — like she was continuing the journey, pushing forward to her final moments.
- On suit AI, finds final recording/note with a message to Jet:

> "Son, things are looking dismal for me out here. Ship is blown, lone survivor, not another living soul in sight. On entry, ship did pick up something on the scanner to the Northwest. So I'm scavenging for whatever I can find and heading that direction on my own two feet. It could be a glacier, ice shifting, snowdrift, or nothing. Then again it could be life! After everything I have seen on this mission I am counting nothing out!
>
> I am the first human to make it to the edge of our solar system. I broke a lot of firsts to get here — asteroid belt, ALIENS! Saturn, Uranus, and now Neptune. 1 year on this planet is 165 years on Earth. 165! It boggles the mind.
>
> I know you must feel lonely or angry with me. Leaving you on Earth and me leaving on a one way trip to the edge of the universe. If I could trade it all for another Earth day with you... I wouldn't do it. It's a bad trade. Instead of a finite time with you, I would rather prove to you that once you push yourself to the edge of everything you comprehend... and go beyond... your limit is infinity.
>
> After all, I named you Kyper not to be a hipster, but to give you a target. Go beyond me, Son. I hope my footsteps provide guidance along your journey. Godspeed."

**Open question**: Does the player know the whole time that she's dead? What if that isn't revealed until the very end?

### Main Goal

Jet's goal is to discover what happened to his Mother and deal with his feelings of loss along the journey. He does not have hope, and even when he gets signs of hope he is resistant to give into them. He is pessimistic; the player is optimistic because they will have the hope.

Jet is returning back to earth to bury his mother's remains. Anything else? Is he saving earth? TBD.
