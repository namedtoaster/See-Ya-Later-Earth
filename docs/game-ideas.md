# Game Ideas

> We will have lots of ideas, but we need to make it as simple as possible. It is very easy to lose scope quickly. Focus on the story.

## Theme

- Space survival
- RPG
- Twist options?
  - Previous humanoid life has already inhabited this planet/solar system
  - Maybe at the end, the alien people realize the people of earth are just plain shitty so they destroy them or something

## Intro

You are the sole adventurer tasked with exploring a new planet. The year is 2098 and everyone on earth has basically just shit on everything. So we need to find a new planet to inhabit or basically everyone is dead. It also doesn't help that many world leaders eat crayons for breakfast so they're not much help.

Normally, you would be accompanied by a highly skilled astronaut to explore the depths of space, but ya know, nobody actually cares. Ignorance is bliss and all. So there's basically no funding. How did you get this job anyway? You sell organic lip balm at a farmers market. Anyway...

After surprisingly not dying on the violent entry into the atmosphere of the first planet you are going to explore, you land on a pretty inconspicuous looking part of the planet. Since you're a dumbass, you decide to take off your helmet to see what the air "tastes like". Well obviously you die immediately. Thankfully, you have been equipped with a life regenerating device that basically makes you immortal. It definitely wasn't implemented to make coming back to life a realistic part of the story so the game makes more sense.

Blah blah blah, you're here to find some place worthy of inhabitation and you have to try not to die.

What if in 2098 the sun went burned and your end all mission was to go replace the lightbulb to save all of earth.

## Story Elements

### Main Theme

While some of the ideas we have are decent, I don't think we have a main theme that ties everything together. The way I see it, we can choose from either doom and gloom survive or you'll die or fun and creative explore the world/universe. I think we can make a spectrum with both portions on either side. At the beginning, it's all about just surviving and towards the end, it's about understanding the true meaning of companionship. Yes, you are making friends and forming society with friendly aliens, but this could signify the importance of coming together as a human race. The game is after all about saving the human race. Just a thought.

### Threats/Enemies

- **Space monsters** -- of course
- **Oxygen limitation** -- you can only travel so far
- **Severe lack of food** -- maybe in the intro you end up somehow losing a lot of your food and in order to get more you have to be at a certain place at a certain time of day when earth sends you extra supplies. Otherwise, if you're not there, space creatures come and eat everything. Mars Bars or some punny named candy bar gives you health or energy. Would this "food bar" or hunger bar have a countdown based on in-game time. How long would each day last. 1 hour = 1 day? Some sort of "days away from earth counter". If you die does Elon Musk revive you? (You know, I don't think Elon should actually revive you, but we can make it an easter egg of sorts. Like maybe have one frame where you can barely make out the facial features of him. I think that would be neat)

In order to make the oxygen/food limitation work, we need to integrate it into the goal the player is trying to achieve. Because otherwise it'll just be an annoyance that you have to do in order not to die.

- I guess just like any other survival type game, it just takes time to gather enough resources in order to be able to get to the next step. In this game, maybe you'll be able to save larger quantities of food/oxygen which will allow you to travel farther and discover new things.
- Each level/planet can really just have a certain thing that you can only access if you are able to travel that far. Should be simple enough.

### Levels

Each planet that you travel to must have a main quest - which tie together to satisfy the main quest.

These ideas are not necessarily in the correct gameplay order.

I like the idea of being able to travel to each different planet. However, I'm concerned this will make things too complicated. Perhaps when you are trying to solve a quest on one planet, you need to talk to somebody from one of the other planets you have already visited. Although, the question comes, how are you able to travel? Can you just hop on a ship with endless supply of fuel? Do the local aliens have a transport tech? If so, why can't you transport back to earth?

- **Quest 1 - "Crash Landing" - survive**
  - Establish comm link to earth (this idea might contradict with the part where you get food delivered to you from earth. It's possible that that was an agreed upon thing that was happening regardless, so they don't know yet that you fucked your food up)
    - That or just make it an automated thing that happens. Food resupply box gets sent out once a day at X time (in game time/day) from earth or the unknown. Some kind of uber eats delivery crate with supplies and food either at a designated land site or at random. Maybe gets less often as the days go on.
    - It could be similar to the mechanic in Astroneer except instead of using the oxygen line, you just have to make sure you have enough supplies with you to survive until the next drop
  - Let's say you are able to establish comm with earth by the end of this level/planet. You end up sending one bit of your space location back to earth every time you beat a level since it takes so long for the data to go back (let's say that each level you beat is like a week or something). The reason you can only send so much is that the comm equipment can only handle a certain amount of data

- **Quest 2 - "New Way Of Life" - explore**
  - At the beginning of this level, you are still on the first planet you crash landed on. However, some time has passed since you achieved your last goal and you are living your new monotonous life in space as you do your best to search the planet and assess whether or not the human species will be capable of mass migrating to this new planet. How tf are you supposed to move that many people anyway? Sounds like future me problems
  - The main goal of this level should initially be to just explore different parts of the planet. Maybe one of the first big events will be to find an underground alien civilization that almost kills you after you discover them. Then they end up telling you about different parts of the planet to explore in order to learn more about the environment
  - As to not complicate the game too much and have too many stops, maybe only have the one stop to an ancient civilization that tells about this space fuel that allows you to travel without having to refuel.
  - The end of this level/planet will be when the aliens give you the fuel and help rebuild your spaceship and you begin traveling to the next planet to find more about this planet system

- **Quest 3 - transform**
  - You begin to wonder about why you're really here - to save humankind, yes. But what's going to change? Is this just going to be another planet that the human race will destroy? Will we learn from our mistakes?

- **Quest 4 - meet**
  - As your capability to explore farther and farther expands, you begin to find evidence of extraterrestrial life. What could these aliens look like? How long have they been here? Are they friendly?
  - My vision for these aliens is to make them much like humans in a way - not like the big headed green slimy dudes we're used to from Hollywood. It would be interesting to explore the idea of an ancient civilization - again, something similar to what we might expect on earth but somehow different. This might be a good opportunity to grant this civilization some unexpected ability - something that will help them fight off the human race when they unexpectedly arrive

- **Quest 6 - acculturation**
  - Our new friends are helping us understand how to live in space -- space travel, farming, mining, etc. This information helps the main character understand how to restart the human race.

- **Quest 7 - war**
  - Almost forgotten, a large fleet of spaceships from earth are able to locate the main character - at least the planet he's on. Their intent - destroy anything in order to restart the human race
  - How are they able to fly to space? Are they just leaving earth because the main character stopped replying and they needed somewhere to go?
  - Will this turn into a Pocahontas/Avatar story? I don't want it to so much, but it is a solid story. It would be good to be able to modify it in order to make it more original

- **Quest 8 - peace**
  - The human race and the aliens make peace
  - Shouldn't be as simple as that, but I would like for it to resolve that way
  - I'm sure there are plenty of historical stories to look at to model this story off of - maybe they become the new space feud and you end up choosing a side? This could easily lead into a sequel although I definitely don't want to think about that right now at all. Not until we have something for this game!

- **Quest 9 - the future**
  - Looking forward - how will the humans/aliens coexist?

### Main Goals/Phases

1. **Don't die** (see threats/enemies)
   - Build weapons out of space scrap/minerals ("they're minerals Marie!!")
   - Rebuild space ship in order to travel to other planets. Maybe even start to discover clues of previous humanoid life that lead you to finding remnants of ancient space craft

2. **New meaning of life/change of destiny**
   - Perhaps your focus starts to shift as you start discover this past civilization -- you don't care so much about saving earth. They're fucked anyway. You want to seek out this civilization. You're going to die here anyway. This is where you could let the player decide on if they want to continue to settle for future earth dwellers or just continue to explore. But I think the scope of the game could easily get too big if we start making it that open world
   - As you begin to discover more and more about this past civilization, you find large villages and even cities filled with people who are a part of a long generation of families that settled these planets long ago. Your task here is to find these truths through a series of tasks i.e. exploring temples, reading books in an ancient library, etc.
   - As you integrate yourself more and more into these cultures, the peoples treat you as a god. You must be the one prophesized to save these people. Not sure what the task is here.
   - You then have an existential moment realizing that both earth and these people require salvation. For all time, every culture and kind of people has always needed salvation. You attempt to utilize the technologies of these people/cultures you have engrained yourself with to bring them and the people of earth together

## World

- Top down/isometric view
- Planet traversal dependent on quests completed/credits earned or something

## Food/Oxygen Economy

Maybe 1 bar only lasts like an hour (in a 24 hour period) and one day in game is actually 1 hour real world. So when you travel, you have to have enough to keep you full before you get back. Maybe part of the game is building some sort of crate or pack that you can bring with you. As you get more "points" you can build a bigger one and carry more supplies.

I am assuming oxygen would work the same sort of concept as the hunger and food bars. Maybe an oxygen tank in the daily supply box? And some other way on the planet to resupply. Or go back to your space ship and it resupplies you automatically.

## Andrew's Theme Idea

The title says it all to me. You are a human so fed up with earth, everyone is full Wall-E stage, no one cares for the planet, most of it is uninhabitable and the end is nigh. So you craft yourself a space ship and 'See Ya Later Earth!'

**Story arc**: You hate humanity, but interactions with aliens teach you lessons so eventually you accept humanity and in turn yourself.

- Main character wants to be free of humanity, however time with aliens shows character that problems are universal to all life forms, running from problems is not a solution. Character realizes they are running from personal problems as well. In the end you accept that you have to fix humanity/yourself and use your cool alien tech filled ship (and help from alien pals) to save earth from destruction.

**Gameplay Loop**: Hopping from one planet to the next. Objective is to fix ship or find fuel. Manage oxygen/food/thirst levels while gathering resources. Meet unique alien life forms on each planet, help or fight aliens. Use their tech to better your ship.

> I think we should try to circle back to find out how what the player does in his exploration ties into life back on earth - do they come join him or are they just stuck back on earth
